	Middle Mouse -> to rotate
	Middle Mouse (hold) -> to rotate
	Shift + Middle Mouse -> move from side to side
	Mouse wheel -> zoom in out
	Click -> to select
	Del button -> to delete
	Shift + A -> Add Object Menu
	1 -> front view
	7 -> top view
	2, 3 -> side views (ctrl + 2 -> 3 vice versa)
	N -> coordination menu
	Ctrl + Space -> full shader mode
	H -> hide
	Alt + H -> bring back all

	G + x -> grab and move on x axis (then LMB to apply, RMB to cancel.)
	G -> grab

	. Orthographic view is good when checking from front in grids.
	. Generally perspective view is quiet natural.

	. 5 -> toggle between orthogonal and perspective view
	. 0 -> camera view (mouse middle click to get out)

	. Move 3D Cursor to by (Shift + RMB)

	. can add new objects to new positions using 3D cursor.


	Shading mode is used just to actually see how the object looks like in     reality. but will not calculate light effects.

	Eevee algorithm is fast but unrealistic, Cycles is relistic which calculates ray tracing.


	Edit Mode: 
	E -> Extrude
	Ctrl + r -> move mouse -> right click -> change to plane mode = cutting
	Alt + LMB -> (could use ctrl +, ctrl - to add more) -> multiple selection
	Ctrl + L -> link objects

	. Try to add Scale x = 1, y = 1, z = 1
	. Donot overlap inside edit mode.

	Sculpture Mode:
	X -> draw
	Ctrl hold draw will dip in.
	G -> grap pull
	F -> drag mouse -> increase decrase brush size
	Alt + S -> shrink or enlarge
	K -> knife tool to cut
	select edge -> G + G -> move slice
	Ctrl + J -> join
	Ctrl + R -> loop cut
	Ctrl + R -> mouse wheel -> increase cuts

	Alt + G -> centers the object in the coordinates.
