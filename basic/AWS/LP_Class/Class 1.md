### Virtualization

Virtualization is a framework or methodology of dividing the resources of a computer into multiple execution environment.

Virtualization is an abstraction layer that decouples the physical hardware from the operating system to deliever greater IT resource utilization and flexibility.

- Hardware -> OS -> Application -> CPU -> Memory -> Disk -> Network
- Tradional computer system is not utililized properly therefore we need virtualization.
