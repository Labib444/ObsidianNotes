- If you are using AWS and or even old school local devices, you have to write shell scripts to automate your workflow, pressing UI buttons are not always fast and they are repetitive. Also these script files look horrendous very hard to maintain. Therefore for readability and reliability(because the script file might not work as expected) such IAC tools were created. These are very readable and reliable. Ansible is for version control throughout all the devices, docker is for virtual immutable images and Terraform for provisioning, deployment, or AKA almost like another Cloud, but can also integrate other cloud services.
